      <h1>How To Make a Harry Potter Wand</h1>
      <p>With these easy steps, you will be able to create your very own
        realistic Harry Potter Wand! Here are the things you will need.<br></p>
        <ul>
             <li>8 inch piece of wood</li>
             <li>glue gun</li>
             <li>tempra or acrlyic paint</li>
             <li>finishing spray</li>

          </ul>
      <p><strong>Lets begin!</strong>

        <ol> 1. First you will need an 8 inch piece of wood
          about the width of a pencil.
    <ul><i> -Because wands vary in size, whatever length or width
      is up to you.</i><ul></p>
        <ol> 2. Next you will need a glue gun.
    <ul><i> -To create the texture on the wand<br>
    the glue gun will act as a tool to create any<br>
  design you want.</i></ul></p>
<!-- Could not figure out what I did wrong with trying to get the 3. back -->
<ol> 3. Once you have created your design and let <br>
  it dry, you are ready for paint.<ol/>

<ul> -Paint it any color you like! Once dry spray with setting spray to give a glossy look.<br> <ul>
