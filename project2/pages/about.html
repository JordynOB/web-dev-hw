        I choose the idea of wand making for this project because it is simple to create,<br>
        fun to do and it's Halloween themed. (Considering Halloween is right around the corner)<br>
        I came along this idea last year in the University Center. It was Harry Potter week<br>
        and there were all kinds of fun booths you could go to. I found the wand making one and <br>
        decided I wanted to make my very own.

        While browsing the Wizard Web, I found more Harry Potter crafting ideas.<br>
        I found DIY ideas for crafting felt house ties for costumes or decorations.<br>
        I also found creating your own quil to write with along with eatable mini <br>
        broom sticks.<br>
