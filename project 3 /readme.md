1. I'm going to do a movie quoting website!
2. In this website I will create different and colorful ways of sharing my favorite movie quotes. For example, I'll share...

**Ace Ventura**<br>
*"This is double-paned sound-proof glass. There is no way that neighbor could've heard Roger Podacter scream on the way down with that door shut. The scream she heard came from inside the apartment before he was thrown over the balcony and the murderer closed the door before he left. Yes. Yes. Oh, yeah. Can ya feel that, buddy? Huh? Huh? Huh?
I have exorcised the demons... this house is clear.*

 **I will provide a little background story on the actor who play Ace Ventura, Jim Carrey.**

- I think I will be using color palettes such as... <br>


    color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
    background-color: rgb(32, 32, 32)
    color-text: rgb(255, 255, 255);

- I know it seems plain but its movie themed with black and white. I plan on adding my own style to it as well.
